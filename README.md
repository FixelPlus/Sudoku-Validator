# Sudoku-Validator
Built  a “Sudoku Validator” that checks if the multidimensional array is valid to be included into the game. For convenience of a user, the output reflects an incorrect sub-square in form of a matrix and providing the precise coordinates of the incorrect location of an array in the form of : “ From [x][y] till [x][y] there is an error”.
